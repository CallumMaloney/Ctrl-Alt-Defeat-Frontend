//How to link up frontend with back-end
/*
- Set up API end-points:
    - GET for reading data
    - POST for creating data
    - PUT/PATCH for updating data
    - DELETE for deleting data

Send HTTP requests to API end-point from client-side. 
Recieve status code and data from API end-point in return.

Elements of a HTTP request:
- URL e,g, https://api.example.com/users
- Method e.g. GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE
- Headers e.g. Content-Type: application/json
- 

1. Set up an Express server
2. Set up API end-points to recieve HTTP requests e.g. GET /users etc.
3. check that the API end-points are working by sending HTTP requests to them using Thunder Client (mimicing the client-side code we will write later)
4. write client-side code to send HTTP requests to the API end-points e.g.
5. Create a file with helper functions to send HTTP requests to the API end-points e.g. getRecipes() etc.
6. Import the helper functions into the express server file and use them in the CRUD requests to the API end-points
